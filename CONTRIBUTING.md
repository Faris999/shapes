# Contributing

Maybe you want to help make Shapes betterâ„¢?

You could:
* [Create an issue](https://github.com/photon-niko/shapes/issues/new) when you discover one.
* Code and stuff. I'll probably accept pull requests. See [the roadmap](https://github.com/photon-niko/shapes/blob/main/roadmap.md) :)
* Make more Shapes programs. Show how much can be done in Shapes. Share them in [show and tell](https://github.com/photon-niko/shapes/discussions/categories/show-and-tell).
* Make a better contributing guideline thingy.
